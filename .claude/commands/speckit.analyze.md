## ⛔ CRITICAL: Error Handling

**If ANY script returns an error, you MUST:**
1. **STOP immediately** - Do NOT attempt workarounds or auto-fixes
2. **Report the error** - Show the exact error message to the user
3. **Wait for user** - Ask user how to proceed before taking any action

**DO NOT:**
- Try alternative approaches when scripts fail
- Create branches manually when script validation fails
- Guess or assume what the user wants after an error
- Continue with partial results

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Goal

Identify inconsistencies, duplications, ambiguities, and underspecified items across the three core artifacts (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`) before implementation. This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.

## Operating Constraints

**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).

**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.

## Execution Steps
### Step 0: Validate Task ID

**CRITICAL**: Check task ID argument FIRST before any operations.
**NOTE**: Users must create feature branch manually before running this command.

1. **Parse user input**:
   - Extract first argument from command
   - Expected format: `[folder/]prefix-number`

2. **Check if task ID provided**:
   ```
   If first argument is EMPTY or MISSING:
     ERROR: "Task ID required. Usage: /speckit.analyze {task-id}"
     STOP - Do NOT proceed to Step 1
   ```

3. **Validate task ID format**:
   - Must match pattern: `[folder/]{prefix}-number`
   - `{prefix}` = value from `.speckit.env` SPECKIT_PREFIX_LIST
   - Examples (assuming prefix=pref):
     - ✅ `/speckit.analyze {prefix}-001` → e.g., `pref-001`
     - ✅ `/speckit.analyze hotfix/{prefix}-123` → e.g., `hotfix/pref-123`
     - ✅ `/speckit.analyze AL-991` → if AL in SPECKIT_PREFIX_LIST
     - ❌ `/speckit.analyze` → ERROR (no task ID)
     - ❌ `/speckit.analyze invalid-id` → ERROR (invalid format)

4. **Determine feature directory**:
   - Pattern: `.specify/{folder}/{prefix}-number/`
   - Default folder: `features` (from SPECKIT_DEFAULT_FOLDER)
   - Examples (assuming prefix=pref):
     - `{prefix}-001` → `.specify/features/pref-001/`
     - `hotfix/{prefix}-123` → `.specify/hotfix/pref-123/`

**Error Handling**:
- If task ID missing → ERROR with usage example, STOP
- If task ID invalid format → ERROR with format requirements, STOP
- If feature directory not found → ERROR, suggest running `/speckit.specify` first

**After Validation**:
- Proceed to Step 1 only if task ID valid
- Use task ID to locate feature files in `.specify/{folder}/{task-id}/`


### 1. Initialize Analysis Context

**IMPORTANT**: The task ID from Step 0 is ONLY for validation purposes. Do NOT pass it to the script below. The script derives feature directory from current branch automatically.

Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root (NO task ID argument) and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS.
- **Correct**: `check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks`
- **WRONG**: `check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks MRR-1427` ← Do NOT pass task ID!

Derive absolute paths:

- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md
- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md
- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md

Abort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).
For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)

Load only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:

**From spec.md:**

- Overview/Context
- Functional Requirements
- Non-Functional Requirements
- User Stories
- Edge Cases (if present)

**From plan.md:**

- Architecture/stack choices
- Data Model references
- Phases
- Technical constraints

**From tasks.md:**

- Task IDs
- Descriptions
- Phase grouping
- Parallel markers [P]
- Referenced file paths

**From constitution:**

- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation

### 3. Build Semantic Models

Create internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):

- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., "User can upload file" → `user-can-upload-file`)
- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria
- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)
- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements

### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)

Focus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.

#### A. Duplication Detection

- Identify near-duplicate requirements
- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation

#### B. Ambiguity Detection

- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria
- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)

#### C. Underspecification

- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome
- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment
- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan

#### D. Constitution Alignment

- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle
- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution

#### E. Coverage Gaps

- Requirements with zero associated tasks
- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story
- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)

#### F. Inconsistency

- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)
- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)
- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)
- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)

### 5. Severity Assignment

Use this heuristic to prioritize findings:

- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality
- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion
- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case
- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order

### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report

Output a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:

## Specification Analysis Report

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |

(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)

**Coverage Summary Table:**

| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|

**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)

**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)

**Metrics:**

- Total Requirements
- Total Tasks
- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)
- Ambiguity Count
- Duplication Count
- Critical Issues Count

### 7. Provide Next Actions

At end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:

- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`
- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions
- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., "Run /speckit.specify with refinement", "Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture", "Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'"

### 8. Offer Remediation

Ask the user: "Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)

## Operating Principles

### Context Efficiency

- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation
- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis
- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow
- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts

### Analysis Guidelines

- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)
- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)
- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)
- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)
- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)
